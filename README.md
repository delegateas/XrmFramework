# XrmFramework [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/delegateas/XrmFramework](https://badges.gitter.im/delegateas/XrmFramework.svg)](https://gitter.im/delegateas/XrmFramework?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
XrmFramework is a project that contains the structure Delegate uses for every XRM project. It has all of our tools and shows how we use our tools together to create a better experience for developers.

## Solution structure
The solution contains the following projects

* **BusinessDomain** contains the generated context from XrmContext.
* **BusinessLogic** contains the businesslogic that is being called by the plugins. These use the context from Businessdomain.
* **Plugins** contains the definition of all plugins. These are registered using DAXIF.
* **Tests** contains test definitions. All the tests use XrmMockup in order to simulate an XRM instance.
* **Tools** contains the result of installing Daxif, XrmContext and XrmDefinitelyTyped.
* **WebResources** contains webresource definitions. Client-side logic is written using Typescript and XrmDefinitelyTyped.
* **Workflow** contains CodeActivity definitions. These use the context from Businessdomain.

## Renaming the framework
There is a renaming script file at the root. Ensure you have F# installed, open a command prompt and type 
```
rename.cmd comp=Company org=Organization sol=Solution
``` 
where Company is the name of your company, Organization is the name of your organization and Solution is the name of the solution you want to sync your project with. This will replace all occurrences of `DG` with your company, `XrmOrg` with your organization and `XrmSolution` with your solution.

## Configuring DAXIF
The final configuration is done inside `Tools > Daxif > _Config.fsx`. You will see definitions like this.

```fsharp
  let dev = 
    Environment.Create(
      name = "Development",
      url = "https://mydev.crm4.dynamics.com/XRMServices/2011/Organization.svc",
      ap = AuthenticationProviderType.OnlineFederation,
      creds = creds,
      args = fsi.CommandLineArgs
    )
```

Replace the details of the environment as needed. Do the same for each environment you have. We have dev, test, and prod by default. 

Go down to `PublisherInfo` and modify the information. Notice that if you modify the prefix you must also modify the prefix of the folder in `WebResources > src > dg_xxx`, since it is used to mark the webresource folder for DAXIF WebResourceSync.

## Ready
If you have done the above, then you are ready to start the development of your project. Build in release and sync your local files!
